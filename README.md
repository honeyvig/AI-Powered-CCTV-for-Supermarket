---
Setting up an AI-powered CCTV system for a 300m² supermarket that includes face recognition, behavior analysis, dwell time tracking, and integration with POS data is a great way to optimize store operations and potentially boost sales. Here's a step-by-step approach to setting up the system, along with the required components:
1. Camera Setup (8 Cameras for Full Coverage)

    Camera Placement:
        Plan the camera positions to ensure complete coverage of the supermarket, including entrances, aisles, shelves, cash registers, and high-traffic areas. The cameras should cover both overhead (for full store views) and narrow, aisle-level perspectives for detailed monitoring.
        Make sure the cameras have wide-angle lenses (e.g., 120° or more) to avoid blind spots.

    Camera Models:
        Select cameras with at least 1080p resolution for clear video quality. Cameras with IR night vision capabilities are a good idea to cover low-light conditions.
        Brands like Amcrest, Hikvision, or Reolink provide good options for high-definition, reliable cameras.

    Frigate Integration:
        Install Frigate, an open-source NVR (Network Video Recorder) system that integrates with AI to provide object detection, person detection, and motion alerts.
        Frigate is capable of running AI models directly on the Google Coral USB Accelerator, which will significantly speed up video processing and face recognition tasks.

2. Hardware Setup

    Google Coral USB Accelerator:
        This device provides hardware-accelerated AI inference for edge devices. It will be used to accelerate video processing tasks like face recognition and behavior analysis.
        Connect the Coral USB Accelerator to your server or NAS where Frigate will run the AI models for faster object detection, tracking, and behavior analysis.

    Synology NAS (Network Attached Storage):
        The Synology NAS will serve as the primary storage for both video footage and AI event data. Choose a Synology model that can handle video streaming, data storage, and multiple camera streams (e.g., Synology DS220+ or DS920+).
        Install Surveillance Station on the NAS to manage the camera feeds and store footage. Surveillance Station supports many camera brands, and it integrates well with third-party systems like Frigate.

    Network Setup:
        Ensure you have a robust network with enough bandwidth to handle the constant video feeds from 8 cameras. Use PoE (Power over Ethernet) cameras for ease of installation.
        Connect the cameras to a PoE switch and then to the NAS via a wired network.

3. AI Features (Face Recognition, Behavior Analysis, Dwell Time Tracking)

    Face Recognition:
        Use Frigate to run face recognition models that can identify specific individuals within the supermarket. For this, you'll need to train the model on known employee faces or even potential customers if consent is obtained.
        Frigate can trigger an alert whenever a particular person (e.g., VIP customers, repeat offenders) enters the store or lingers in a particular area.

    Behavior Analysis (Loitering, Falling Objects, etc.):
        Implement AI-powered behavior analysis models to track movements within the store. The Google Coral Accelerator can run object detection models (like TensorFlow Lite) to monitor behaviors such as:
            Loitering: Detect if a person is standing in one location for an extended period (potentially leading to theft prevention or customer service interventions).
            Falling Objects: Set up alerts when items are dropped from shelves (for safety and inventory management).

    Dwell Time Tracking:
        Use Frigate's object tracking features to monitor how long each customer spends in specific areas of the store (e.g., in front of high-margin products, promotional areas).
        This can be done by analyzing motion paths and tracking the time each person spends within a designated zone.

4. POS Data Integration for Sales Impact Analysis

    Integration with POS Data:
        Data Flow: Set up a system to pull data from your Point of Sale (POS) system, such as sales data, customer transactions, and product scans. Many POS systems can export CSV or integrate via an API for real-time data extraction.
        Dwell Time and Sales Correlation: Compare the dwell times in specific areas with sales data for the same areas/products. For example, if customers spend more time in a particular aisle, does it correlate with an increase in sales for that aisle?
        Advanced Analytics: Use AI or data analytics tools to compare behavior patterns (e.g., longer dwell times, frequent store visits) with purchasing habits. You can even segment the data by customer profiles if you have a loyalty program or customer IDs linked to purchases.

5. Data Storage and AI Event Logs

    Event Data Logging:
        All AI-triggered events (e.g., person detection, loitering, falling objects) should be logged and stored in the Synology NAS for analysis. You can use Frigate’s API to send these logs in real time to a centralized storage or database.
        Store AI event data in a structured format (JSON, CSV) so that it's easy to analyze trends and correlations.

    Video Footage Storage:
        Store video footage for a set retention period on the Synology NAS. Surveillance Station can manage the storage and automate the deletion of old footage.
        Use H.265 or H.264 video compression to maximize storage space without sacrificing video quality.

6. Monitoring and Alerts

    Real-time Alerts:
        Set up Frigate or the Surveillance Station to send real-time alerts based on certain criteria, such as when a face is recognized or when loitering is detected. You can configure the system to send alerts via SMS or email to store managers or security personnel.
    Dashboard & Analytics:
        Create a custom dashboard where all real-time event data, video feeds, and POS data can be viewed together.
        Use software like Grafana to visualize dwell time vs. sales data, behavior analysis outcomes, and even foot traffic patterns.

7. Experiment to Increase Sales

    Hypothesis:
        The hypothesis for this experiment could be that tracking customer behavior (e.g., longer dwell times in certain sections, the impact of specific product displays) allows for more efficient sales strategies, promotions, or inventory management that ultimately increases sales.

    Experimental Setup:
        Control Group: Implement the AI-powered system in one section of the store (e.g., a specific aisle or promotional area) to monitor behavior and sales.
        Test Group: Implement the system across the entire store and compare the sales performance of monitored sections against unmonitored sections.

    Key Metrics to Track:
        Dwell time: Does more time in a specific section correlate with higher sales?
        Customer Segmentation: Are there certain customer types that tend to spend more (e.g., returning customers)?
        Product Impact: Does product placement or promotions in high-dwell-time areas lead to increased sales?
        POS Data Analysis: Directly compare AI-identified behaviors (like interest in high-margin areas) with the sales data for those same areas/products.

Summary

With the combination of Frigate, Google Coral USB Accelerator, Synology NAS, and the integration with POS data, this AI-powered CCTV system has the potential to optimize store operations and potentially increase sales. The real-time tracking of customer behaviors, dwell times, and integration with sales data will provide actionable insights, allowing you to test hypotheses on customer behavior and sales correlation.
Let's break down the steps in more detail for setting up Frigate and integrating POS data into the system. This will ensure that your AI-powered CCTV system is fully operational and optimized for your experiment.
1. Setting Up Frigate for AI-Powered CCTV

Frigate is an open-source NVR (Network Video Recorder) with built-in AI that can handle face recognition, object detection, and behavior analysis using machine learning models. We'll go step by step to set it up with Google Coral USB Accelerator and your cameras.
1.1 Install Frigate on a Server (or Synology NAS)

    Install Docker (if you’re running Frigate on a server or Synology NAS):
        Docker is the easiest way to deploy Frigate. You can install Docker on your server (Windows, Linux) or on your Synology NAS via the Synology Package Center.
        For Synology NAS, make sure it supports Docker (available on models with Intel or AMD processors).

    Create a Docker Compose Configuration: This will allow you to configure and deploy Frigate along with the necessary AI models (using Coral USB Accelerator). Here’s a basic docker-compose.yml example:

version: "3.8"
services:
  frigate:
    image: blakeblackshear/frigate:stable
    container_name: frigate
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"  # Web interface
      - "1935:1935"  # RTSP streaming
    volumes:
      - /mnt/recordings:/media/frigate/recordings
      - /etc/frigate/config.yml:/config/config.yml
    devices:
      - "/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb"  # For Coral USB Accelerator
    environment:
      - FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD=your_rtsp_password
    shm_size: "512mb"  # Adjust shared memory for Coral Accelerator

1.2 Configure Frigate’s Configuration File (config.yml)

Once Frigate is installed via Docker, you will need to configure it for your cameras and AI features. Here’s an example configuration to set up 8 cameras and AI features:

mqtt:
  host: "mqtt_server_ip"
  user: "mqtt_user"
  password: "mqtt_password"
  topic_prefix: "frigate"
  
cameras:
  camera1:
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
        - path: rtsp://your_camera_ip/stream
          roles:
            - detect
            - record
    width: 1920
    height: 1080
    fps: 5
    zones:
      front_door:
        coordinates: "100,100,200,100,200,200,100,200"  # Define your custom zone for analysis

  camera2:
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
        - path: rtsp://your_camera_ip/stream
          roles:
            - detect
            - record
    width: 1920
    height: 1080
    fps: 5

  # Repeat for all 8 cameras...
  
detectors:
  coral:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb  # Use Coral USB Accelerator for faster AI inference

record:
  enabled: True
  retain:
    days: 7  # Retain footage for 7 days

1.3 Configuring Face Recognition and Behavior Analysis

For face recognition, you will need to provide a dataset with the faces of employees or VIP customers that you want the system to recognize. You can use Frigate’s built-in features to capture faces. For behavior analysis (e.g., loitering, falling objects), you’ll need to set up object detection rules and configure zones within the store for monitoring.

    Face Recognition: Frigate does not have out-of-the-box face recognition but can integrate with other services like DeepStack AI or Facebox for face recognition. Set up an API endpoint in Frigate and configure it to call the face recognition service whenever a face is detected.

    Loitering and Object Detection: Frigate can track objects and persons based on motion. You can define zones where loitering is detected if someone stays too long in a specific area. You could set up a zone around high-value or high-margin products, for example.

Example of detecting loitering (custom rule):

zones:
  aisle_1:
    coordinates: "100,100,200,100,200,200,100,200"
    max_duration: 600  # If someone stays for 10 minutes, trigger an alert

    Falling Objects: Implement a custom model (like YOLO or TensorFlow Lite) to detect when an object falls off a shelf. You may need to train the model on a dataset of falling objects and use it in Frigate for real-time processing.

1.4 Verify Setup and Run

    Once your configuration is complete, you can restart the Frigate container using Docker:

docker-compose up -d

    Access Frigate’s web interface at http://<server_ip>:5000. You should see live camera feeds, and if everything is set up correctly, AI detection (face recognition, object tracking) will be shown in real time.

2. Integrating POS Data for Sales Analysis

Integrating POS data with Frigate’s behavior tracking will allow you to correlate customer behavior with sales data, providing insights into how store layout, promotions, or product placement affect sales.
2.1 Accessing POS Data

To access your POS data, the most common methods are:

    API Access: If your POS system supports API integration, you can connect to the POS database to extract sales data in real time (e.g., transaction details, item scans, sales by category).

    CSV Export: If your POS system allows for CSV exports, set up a regular export of sales data, including transaction IDs, product IDs, time of purchase, and sales amounts.

    Database Access: For more direct access, you can connect to the POS database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) using a script that periodically pulls sales data.

2.2 Creating the Integration (Using Python Example)

A simple Python script can be used to pull data from the POS system and integrate it with Frigate. Below is an example of how you can fetch sales data and correlate it with dwell time:

import requests
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Define API endpoint for POS system
pos_api_url = 'http://pos-system.local/api/sales'

# Fetch sales data from POS API
response = requests.get(pos_api_url)
sales_data = response.json()  # Assuming JSON response

# Convert sales data to pandas DataFrame
sales_df = pd.DataFrame(sales_data)

# Correlating with Frigate AI events (e.g., dwell time)
frigate_data = pd.read_csv('frigate_event_logs.csv')  # Example Frigate event log file

# Merge data based on timestamp
merged_data = pd.merge(sales_df, frigate_data, left_on='timestamp', right_on='event_time')

# Analyze correlation (e.g., if longer dwell times correlate with higher sales)
correlation = merged_data.groupby('product_id').agg({
    'dwell_time': 'mean',
    'sale_amount': 'sum'
})

print(correlation)

2.3 Analyzing the Data

Once the POS data is integrated with the AI events from Frigate, you can perform various analyses to see if customer behavior impacts sales:

    Dwell Time vs. Sales: Correlate the average dwell time in specific aisles with the sales in those aisles.
    Customer Segments: Segment the data by customer profiles (if you have a loyalty program) and analyze their behavior vs. sales.
    Product Impact: Track the behavior around certain products or promotional areas and see if it leads to increased sales.

You can use tools like Excel, Power BI, or even Tableau to visualize and analyze these correlations.
2.4 Testing and Reporting

    Test the system for a couple of weeks or months, capturing both behavior data (via Frigate) and sales data (via POS system).
    Use the insights to tweak store layout, product placements, or promotions based on which customer behaviors lead to increased sales.

Conclusion

By setting up Frigate with Google Coral USB Accelerator and integrating POS data, you’ll be able to track customer behavior in real time and see how it correlates with sales. This can be used to refine store layout, improve customer experiences, and optimize sales strategies.
